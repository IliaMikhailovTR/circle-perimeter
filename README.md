# Circle Perimeter Calculator

This project provides utilities for calculating the perimeter of a circle using two approaches:
a **precise calculation** based on the mathematical formula and an **approximate calculation** using inscribed polygons.
The program also compares the two methods to determine the number of polygon sides required
to achieve a specified precision.
